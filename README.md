# Zing - the Zero packet Ping network utility

Zing is a lightweight, zero packet utility similar to ping, that provides similar functionality as the ubiquitous ping network utility. The Zing network utility was published in Linux magazine for December 2022 Issue 265/2022 as "Zing Me" here: https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2022/265/Zing#article_i5 

A follow up article about an implementation as a bash shell script was published in Admin Magazine 77/2023 as "Have a Bash with the Zing network utility Zinger" here: https://www.admin-magazine.com/Archive/2023/77/Have-a-Bash-with-the-Zing-network-utility. 

The userbook as an ebook "Zing This!" is here: https://books2read.com/u/bOEVPo and is available in this GitHub repository under the directory "books" as ePub and PDF documents. 

Features
========

* No data payload is sent or received, to avoid network congestion.
* Ability to check both for a host and the ports are alive and available.
* Calculate the time to reach a host via connect and disconnect.
* Available to run on multiple platforms in this case Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Work with Internet Protocol version 4 and version 6 addresses.
* Similar parameters and report of data as ping--a familiar look and feel to the utility.

Installation
============

The Zing network utility requires Java 8 or JDK 8 in order to run. You can download a version of the 
OpenJDK 8 from many sources on the Internet. 

I personally use and like the Azul Systems OpenJDK 8 which you can download from: https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&package=jdk 

After downloading, then double-check the JDK is successfully installed by opening a console or terminal and running:

![Verify Java Installed](https://raw.github.com/wgilreath/zing/master//screenshot_java_install_runs.png?raw=true "Verify Java installed")

Running
=======

After successfully compiling the zing network utility, you can run it simply with java as:

* Classfile .class
* Jar file .jar

### Classfile .class


![Run Zing with classfile](https://raw.github.com/wgilreath/zing/master/screenshot_zing_run_java_classfile.png?raw=true "Run Zing with classfile")



### JAR file .jar

### Shell Alias

An alias in Linux/macOS can simplify running the Zing network utility. 


* Zing classfile .class alias


![Run Zing using alias for class file](https://raw.github.com/wgilreath/zing/master/screenshot_alias_class_zing_run.png?raw=true "Run Zing using alias for class file")


* Zing JAR file .jar alias

Screenshots
===========

Here are some example screenshots showing both **ping** and **zing** in action on the Internet. The ping network utility fails but zing succeeds.

### Ping TCP/IP v4 nist.gov

An example ping failure using **ping** utility to ping "nist.gov" which fails...

### Zing IPv4 nist.gov

An example zing success using **zing** utility to zing "nist.gov" which succeeds...

### Zing and Ping IPv4 nist.gov

A "side-by-side" comparison of both **ping** and **zing** to the same address of nist.gov...

### Zing IPv6 one.one.one.one

An example of **ping** to open-DNS server one.one.one.one using TCP/IP v6 to the host...
